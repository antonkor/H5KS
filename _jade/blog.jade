					p Whether you are part of a larger real estate brand or a small local brokerage your business can benefit from niche marketing.
					p Every brokerage has something special to ofer. For instance, among real estate professionals Keller Williams is known for their supportive infrastructure and family philosophy. REMAX is thought of as the entrepreneurial organization that is always trying new things. Even individual agents can build a niche for themselves. It seems like there is a “Condo King” in almost every market.
					p These businesses are successful, in part, because they’ve used their niche to their advantage. By default, you have a niche in your geographical area and you have the potential to have a niche in other ways too. All you have to do is figure out what that niche is and market it. It is your niche marketing that’s going to set your brokerage apart from the others, no matter their marketing budget or brand muscle.
					p What is niche marketing?
					p Niche marketing has been defined as “…a specialized market ofering focused on the needs of a tightly-defined market segment.” In plain speak, that means you narrow your focus rather than expand it. You’re not going to compete against a national brand. You’re going to build a local one. You’re going to become known for one specific thing that will make your brokerage stand out…to the point that you’ll “own” that market segment
					p Niches, however, don’t fall out of the sky. Although your brokerage potentially has a niche you can use to diferentiate in the crowded marketplace, it is something you will need to both determine and define before you begin any marketing around it
					p How other businesses have “found” their niche
					p Determining your possible niche market can seem a little overwhelming when you eat, breathe, sleep your business every day, making it hard to have any objectivity about it. So let’s step out of the field of real estate for a minute and see if that helps you wrap your head around the possibilities of niche marketing, by taking a look at three real-life examples of niche marketing at work and the lessons you can draw from them.
					p Example 1: Determine what you’re really selling
					p Threadless is a t-shirt and apparel website that determines their product line based on the results of online design competitions. The company has created a niche marketplace of trendsetting hipsters, artists and design aficionados seeking wearable art. Threadless isn’t selling t-shirts as much as a creative outlet and chance to be recognized. What are you really selling? Helping buyers and sellers of real estate is a broad definition, but helping small families by their first homes is a narrow one, for example
					p Example 2: Stand out on service
					p Yearbook Innovation diferentiated their yearbook products by ofering more hands-on customer and production services than their competitors. As a result, the company has begun to take away market share from entrenched competitors in their local area. Ask yourself, why is your service better than that of your competitors? And if it’s not, what special services can you provide that will diferentiate your business and help you to stand out?
					p Example 3: Identify an untapped audience
					p Toyota was one of the first companies to realize some car buyers would buy environmentally friendly cars. They developed the Prius, the first mass-produced hybrid car, to meet that need. Where other car manufacturers saw Toyota taking a huge risk, Toyota saw it as an opportunity to identify a new niche and establish their brand in that niche. Is there a market that’s not yet being served by another brokerage? Get creative here and think outside the box, being as specific as you can be. Consider geography, age, income, type of job…even the pain of a lengthy commute might lead you to discover a subset of the market with an unmet need.
					p After the niche comes the marketing
					p Once you’ve determined and defined your niche, let the marketing begin. Refine your brand and your messaging to accurately (and convincingly) communicate this niche to your target audience. Avoid the trap of generalities, thinking you’ll “lose” business if you fail to paint with a broad brush and try to speak in a generic way to a larger segment. The opposite is true: The more narrowly and specifically you can speak to a target audience, the more your message will resonate with that audience. Be willing to be targeted with your niche, to diferentiate your brokerage from the competition and stand out in a crowd.
